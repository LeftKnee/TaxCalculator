# Regarding Case ID 70561447

## Objection to the application for departure in terms of the municipal planning by-law, 2015: as brought forward by Mr Johns of ERF 51748, 21 Garrison Road, Claremont

I, Willem Steyn who is the current owner of the neighbouring and boundary-wall adjacent property to the applicant Mr Johns as stated above - live in 63 Garfield Street, Claremont, Erf number 51759, supply my reasons of objection as following below:

- **Structural**
  - Building against the existing boundary wall is likely to compromise this wall during building and in future when the proposed new dwelling foundation settles.
    - Now and in future when Mr Johns may have sold his property, I will become responsible for the upkeep and general maintenance of this entire wall of the second dwelling facing my property, since access to that section will be possible only from my property.
    - The &quot;foot&quot; of the new foundations will have to be dug underneath the existing boundary wall due to the proximity of the wall for the proposed second dwelling. This in itself will compromise the existing wall during the building process and in the future.
  - The plans show that roof water run-off from the proposed second dwelling will be collected in gutters that are facing my property. The maintenance and cleaning of this gutter will then fall to me since Mr Johns will not be able to access these due to the construction layout proposed.
  - Furthermore, the water run-off of these gutters is not clearly provided for on the plans. Roof water run-off must be directed into storm-water drainage which is not available at that location of Mr Johns&#39; property and neither are these new drainages provided for or indicated on the building plans.
  - **Fire hazard:**
    - Having a second dwelling this close to the surrounding properties will pose a direct threat to the adjacent properties in the case of a structural fire taking place on Mr Johns&#39; property.
  - **Hot water cylinders**
    - These are not indicated on the redacted building plans and based on the structure of the roof and total height, it can only mean that these could be added now - or in the future - to the actual top side of the roof itself. This will further negatively impact the perceived property values since these structures are not visually pleasing in any way.

- **Environmental**
  - Mr Johns will have to destroy at least three mature trees on his property.
    - Contrary to what was stated as part of his motivation aspects.
  - The blackwood tree on my property will suffer damage and likely die, due to root damage being caused to this endemic tree when the new dwelling&#39;s foundation is laid.
  - Claremont and surrounding neighbourhoods are known for their &quot;green&quot; nature and trees. Mr Johns&#39; proposed development will be going directly against that suburbian profile and will not be in keeping with any of the surrounding properties.
- **Financial**
  - My property value will be impacted negatively due to the new boxed-in feature that will now become my backyard, which is one of the reasons why I bought this property after moving out of Observatory - where this type of close-proximity building happened due to historical and other reasons.
  - The appeal and thus the value of my property will be negatively affected by this close-proximity wall that detracts from the openness of my backyard and garden space.
- **Aesthetics**
  - My backyard and garden is our primary space to relax, entertain and enjoy the openness of the particular suburban structures in Claremont. Having the proposed second dwelling wall block out 68% of that open space will have a negative impact on this living space and the quality of the area.
  - With the positioning and orientation of this structure and its height, sunlight will be obscured from my garden - and in the process destroy the existing growth already established there.
- **Noise pollution and privacy**
  - Mr Johns&#39; existing head-count numbers 6 people in total on his property. This second dwelling will add at least another 2 people to that count, which will cause additional noise and light pollution.
  - In the future, a new owner of that property may decide to add even more people into the dwelling, and possibly use it for commercial purposes such as AirBnB - or a student residence.
    - Either of these scenarios affords me as the boundary neighbour zero protection against noise pollution or security and will remove our own right to peace and quiet.
  - Any maintenance to the roof structure or gutters of this new dwelling will require that those performing the maintenance will look directly, closely and uninvited into my backyard space, which we use as our primary relaxation area.
    - Further, our master bedroom privacy will be directly impacted - day and night - with those windows facing the existing boundary wall - for any maintenance now, while building or in the future.
  - Proposed second dwelling kitchen, bathroom and toilet extractor fans:
    - These are not clearly indicated on the redacted building plans supplied to us, neither is the expected noise levels of these devices.

## Further motivations against the proposed departure:

- Mr Johns list as the main motivator for this second dwelling as socio-economic, to provide living and housing for his parents.
  - While this is a noble reason, the surrounding and directly affected property owners have no guarantee what the structure and rest of the property will be used for - now or in the future, with either Mr Johns still as the owner of the property, or having it sold to a new owner.
- Mr Johns also lists the positive effect this development will have on his property but neglects any mention of the negative or potentially positive impact this will have on the surrounding property owners.
- Mr Johns states that this dwelling will afford additional security to the surrounding properties, but while this may be true during his tenure as owner, that security can be compromised by any new tenants and/or owners.
  - One of the main reasons why we moved out of Observatory 7 years ago and to Claremont was due to the attraction of open-space areas and being slightly more removed from surrounding properties.
  - We were forced to sell and move due to a neighbour behind us where this exact same situation reached a stage where serious police intervention was required - with the resultant negative impact on our property value there and also our own peaceful space and security.
- Mr Johns also indicates the existing pizza oven and braai structures that he has built on his property as NEW and part of this development, which leads me to believe that those structures were built without plans and approval.
  - This type of disingenuity by Mr Johns does raise my level of concern about other aspects that may also be obscured in his application since we could only be furnished with redacted building plans.

**To close, I strongly object to the entire proposed departure and will not support this application if any allowances or different conditions are met by the applicant.**

**Signed: Willem Steyn**
